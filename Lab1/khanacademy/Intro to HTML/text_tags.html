       <strong> Nobody’s born smart.</strong><br> <em>We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br></em>
        <strong>Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike.</strong><br> <em>Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br></em>
        <strong>There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.</strong><br>
        <strong>And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.</strong><br>
        Thankfully,<em> we are born to learn.</em><br>
        <em>Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.</em><br>
        <em>Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.</em><br>
        Until one day, <strong>you walk.</strong><br>
        <strong>One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.</strong><br>
        <em>Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.</em><br>
        <strong>Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.</strong><br>
        <strong>This. is. learning.</strong><br>
        <em>It’s not that you don’t get it.</em> <br>
        <em>You just don’t get it, yet.</em><br>
        Because the most <strong>beautiful,</strong> <em>complex concepts in the whole universe</em><br>
        are built on basic ideas that <em>anyone,</em> <em>anywhere can understand.</em><br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>You only have to know one thing:</strong><br>
        <strong>You can learn anything.</strong>
